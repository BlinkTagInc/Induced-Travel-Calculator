      <h1 class="mt-4">About the Induced Travel Calculator</h1>

      <p>Attempts to address traffic congestion commonly rely on increasing roadway capacity, e.g. by building new roadways or adding lanes to existing facilities. But studies examining that approach indicate it is only a temporary fix. They
        consistently show that adding roadway capacity in congested areas actually increases network-wide vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by a nearly equivalent proportion within a few years, reducing or negating the initial congestion relief. That
        increase in VMT is called “induced travel.”</p>

      <p>The induced travel concept is not new (see the “fundamental law of highway congestion” <a href="https://trid.trb.org/view/694596">Anthony Downs suggested in 1962</a>). Indeed, it is explained by the bedrock economic principles of supply and demand: “adding capacity decreases travel
        time, in effect lowering the ‘price’ of driving; when prices go down, the quantity of driving goes up” (<a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/policies/hwycapacity/highway_capacity_brief.pdf">Handy and Boarnet, 2014a</a>). But how big is the effect? What are the elasticities of VMT with respect to lane miles (defined as the percent
        change in VMT divided by the percent change in lane miles)?</p>

      <p>A slew of studies beginning in the late 1990s have estimated similar elasticities, despite using a range of methods to control other VMT-inducing factors and the bi-directional relationship between VMT and capacity expansion. In general,
        the studies show that a 10-percent increase in capacity is likely to increase network-wide VMT by 6 to 10 percent (i.e. an elasticity of 0.6 to 1.0) in the long run (5 to 10 years), with greater elasticities for expansions of major highways
        (e.g. on interstates) than for capacity increases on other roadways. These longer-term elasticities account for short-run shifts in travel (as people take advantage of the increased capacity and travel speed by driving more), as well as
        longer-run dispersion of residential and business location and development.</p>

      <p>For more information on the induced travel and other impacts of highway expansion, see Handy (<a href="www.dot.ca.gov/newtech/researchreports/reports/2015/10-12-2015-NCST_Brief_InducedTravel_CS6_v3.pdf">2015</a>) and Handy and Boarnet (2014a). For a summary of key studies estimating the elasticity of VMT with respect to lane miles, see Handy and
        Boarnet (<a href="https://www.arb.ca.gov/cc/sb375/policies/hwycapacity/highway_capacity_bkgd.pdf">2014b</a>).</p>

      <h1>Calculator Purpose and Scope</h1>

      <p>This calculator allows users to estimate the annual VMT induced by adding general-purpose lane miles to interstate or state route highways in one of California’s urbanized counties (counties within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)). To
        obtain an induced VMT estimate for a highway capacity expansion project, users need only enter the project length (in lane miles added) and geography (MSA for interstate lane additions; county for state route projects).

        Calculator use is not appropriate in all circumstances or for all purposes, however. The following caveats apply:
        <ul>
          <li>The calculator is limited to use for capacity expansions. It cannot be used to estimate VMT effects of capacity reductions or lane type conversions.</li>
          <li>The calculator is limited to use for additions of general-purpose and high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes. Hundreds of both general-purpose and HOV lane mile additions were included in the two studies used to derive the elasticities for
            the calculator <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.6.2616">(Duranton and Turner, 2011</a>; <a href="https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/lse/jtep/2002/00000036/00000003/art00005">Cervero and Hansen, 2002</a>; <a
              href="https://lao.ca.gov/2000/010700_hov/010700_hov_lanes.html">Legislative Analyst’s Office, 2000</a>). By contrast, only a few toll and high-occupancy toll (HOT) lanes were added to California interstates or state routes before the
            end of the data collection periods for the two studies (see <a href="www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/tm/docs/Caltrans_HOV-ExpressLaneBizPlan2009.pdf">Caltrans, 2009</a>). Their induced demand impacts may therefore not be accurately estimated
            by the elasticities reported in those studies</li>
          <li>The calculator is limited to use for lane additions on interstate highways and state route highways.</li>
          <li>The calculator is limited to use in California’s 37 urbanized counties (<mark>counties within MSAs</mark>). The calculator cannot be used to assess the VMT effects of roadway expansions in California counties outside of MSAs, or in any geography
            outside California. Please also be aware that there are a few MSAs (<mark>Chico, Madera, Oxnard-Thousand Oaks-Ventura, Salinas, San Luis Obispo-Paso Robles-Arroyo Grande, Santa Cruz-Watsonville, Santa Maria-Santa Barbara, Santa Rosa,
            Visalia-Porterville and Yuba City</mark>) in which there are no interstate highways. There is also one MSA (Napa) and one county (Imperial) for which there is insufficient California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) data on interstate or
            state route VMT, respectively, to calculate induced VMT from capacity expansions to those facilities. In those circumstances, the calculator will return an “NA”.</li>
          <li>All estimates produced are long-run estimates of the induced VMT after 5 to 10 years. </li>
          <li>All estimates account for the possibility that some of increased VMT on the expanded facility is traffic diverted from other types of roads in the network. In general, the studies show that “capacity expansion leads to a net increase
            in VMT, not simply a shifting of VMT from one road to another” (Handy and Boarnet, 2014a).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Data and Elasticities</h1>

        <p>To estimate induced VMT for user-specified capacity expansion projects, the calculator simply solves this equation:</p>
        <h4 class="mb-3"><em>%∆ Lane Miles x Existing VMT x Elasticity = Project-Induced VMT</em></h4>

        <p>Data sources and specifications for the equation inputs are as follows:</p>

        <p><u><strong>Lane Miles.</strong></u> The percent change in lane miles is calculated by dividing the number of project-added lane miles (input by the user) by the total lane miles of the same facility type in the same geography (using
          Caltrans’ <a href="pems.dot.ca.gov/">Performance Measurement System</a> (PeMS) database). For interstate highways, lane mileage is calculated at the MSA level. For state routes, lane mileage is calculated at the county level. The choice of
          geographies is discussed further below, in conjunction with elasticities.</p>

        <p><u><strong>Existing VMT.</strong></u> As with existing lane miles, existing VMT on interstate highways is calculated at the MSA level, and existing VMT on state routes is calculated at the county level, all using PeMS data.</p>

        <p><u><strong>Elasticities.</strong></u> The calculator uses an elasticity of 1.0 for lane additions to interstate highways, and an elasticity of 0.75 for lane additions to state routes.</p>

        <p>For <strong>interstate highways</strong>, the 1.0 elasticity derives from Duranton and Turner (2011). Duranton and Turner (2011) is the most recent major study on induced travel in the United States, and uses more recent data than other
          studies (e.g. those reviewed in Handy and Boarnet (2014a)). The study uses data from 1983, 1993 and 2003 for all MSAs in the United States (with interstates in urbanized areas). Among other modeling, the study uses a two-stage least
          squares regression with three instrumental variables to estimate the elasticity of vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT) on all interstate highways in MSAs (not just in urbanized areas) with respect to interstate lane kilometers. The authors
          conclude that their estimation method better controls for the possible bi-directional relationship between VMT and lane miles than the methods used in previous studies. Using that “preferred estimation method,” their “preferred estimate”
          is a long-run (10-year) elasticity of 1.03. However, while the authors conclude that “diversion of traffic from other road networks does not appear to play a large role,” they caution that they cannot “rule out the absence of a
          substitution effect.” They “estimate that the diversion of traffic from other classes of roads accounts for between 0 and 10 percent of the total [induced] interstate VKT.”</p>

        <p>Like Duranton and Turner (2011), the calculator uses MSAs as the unit of analysis for interstate highway capacity expansions. The calculator also uses a similar VMT elasticity (1.0), albeit decremented to account for the (small) potential
          substitution effect. That accords with Handy and Boarnet’s (2014a) conclusion that the best estimate for the long-run VMT elasticity for highway lane additions is close to 1.0.</p>

        <p>For <strong>state routes</strong>, the 0.75 elasticity derives from Duranton and Turner (2011) and Cervero and Hansen (2002). While Duranton and Turner (2011) could not use the authors’ preferred method to estimate elasticities for state
          highways and other “major roads” besides interstates, its elasticity estimates using ordinary least squares regression all fall between 0.67 and 0.89. Cervero and Hansen (2002) similarly estimate an intermediate-run (5-year) VMT elasticity
          of 0.79 for lane mile additions to state highways in California’s urbanized counties (then 34, now 37), using three-stage least squares regression. Those elasticities are similar to other longer-term elasticities calculated for combined
          major road types (not just interstate highways) in California and across the United States (Handy and Boarnet, 2014a).</p>

        <p>Like Cervero and Hansen (2002), and because state routes often have less regional impact than interstates (due, e.g., to lower capacity), the calculator uses urbanized counties (those within MSAs) as the unit of analysis for state route
          capacity expansions. The calculator also uses a similar VMT elasticity for state routes (0.75) as Cervero and Hanson (2002) find for state highways (0.79), and within the range Duranton and Turner (2011) found for non-interstate “major
          roads” in the urbanized areas of MSAs (0.67 to 0.89), albeit decremented to account for the (small) potential substitution effect discussed in Duranton and Turner (2011).</p>
