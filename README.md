# Induced Travel Calculator

This calculator allows users to estimate the VMT induced annually as a result of adding general-purpose lane miles, high-occupancy-vehicle (HOV) lane miles, or high-occupancy toll (HOT) lane miles to publicly owned roadways in one of Californiaâ€™s urbanized counties (counties within a metropolitan statistical area (MSA)). The calculator applies only to facilities with Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) functional classifications of 1, 2 or 3. That corresponds to interstate highways (class 1), other freeways and expressways (class 2), and other principal arterials (class 3).
